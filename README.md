# Ping-Pong
Using SDL 2

# Description

SDL 2 Program that uses image loading, 2-D rendering, and text display to create a simple game of Ping Pong.
The program also allows for resolution independence. Resolution is set by the user by one of the menus. The game allows 
for play between two players, a player and a computer, or between two computers. 

# Compiling

When compiling the following .cpp and .h files be sure to have SDL2 libraries and source code. Be sure to have SDL2 TTF and SDL2 Image 
source code and libraries as well.

# Possible Bug

Of the many demos of the program I encountered one such instance in which the ball can become stuck between the left paddle 
and the top border. This only occurs if the right paddle hits the ball with a specific direction that will lead it into the near 
corner of the top. I have yet to find a solution to this and any suggestions regarding this would be fantastic.
